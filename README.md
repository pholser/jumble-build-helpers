# jumble-build-helpers 

An [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) task and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) plugin for invoking the [Jumble](http://jumble.sourceforge.net) Java mutation testing tool.

This currently invokes Jumble via the command line, and is limited to invoking tests compiled against JUnit <= the version of JUnit baked into jumble.jar. Hopefully at some point either the Jumble team will release suitable versions that are not so limited, or I will find time to do this better.

Use however you see fit.
